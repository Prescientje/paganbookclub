## Stoicism

Stoicism is a philosphy founded by Zeno, a 3rd century BC Athenian.
It is founded on and accepting your circumstances because almost everything is outside of your control.

One of the most famous Stoics was Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor whose journal "Meditations" 
has become a very popular book which we will be examining in detail.
